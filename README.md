# Data Structures and Algorithms
Refreshing data structures and algorithms!

A data structure (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

Why DS?
1. Essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms
2. Help to manage and organize data
3. Make code cleaner and easier to understand

Abstract Data Type

An abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.

e.g.

ADT     | DS
------------------------
List    | Dynamic Array
------------------------
Vehicle | Cars, Train
